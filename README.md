In this project, we constructed a classification experiment for tactile data from Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) acupuncture techniques.This folder contains the piezoelectric signal data (RFTR.xls, RDTR.xls, RDTR.xls, and RDLT.xls ) of four acupuncture techniques (reinforcing by twirling and rotating (RFTR), reducing by twirling and rotating (RDTR), reinforcing by lifting and thrusting (RFLT), and reducing by lifting and thrusting (RDLT)) acquired by the tactile array finger-cot, and gives the feature extraction method(Codes)of the piezoelectric signals, as well as the acupuncture techniques classification procedure (Codes) based on the ensemble learning framework. 
The piezoelectric signal sequences are derived from the tactile array finger cot worn by 15 physicians at two institutions: Dongzhimen Hospital of Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Beijing Zhongguancun Hospital. During data acquisition, each physician wearing the tactile array finger cot was required to perform four types of acupuncture techniques.The sampling frequency of the data acquisition system was specified as 100 Hz. Each technique was required to be performed for 40 seconds.
